## Overview
### Project Description

The focus of our project is on food system greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions throughout the world. We will be analyzing the data for trends utilizing various data analysis techniques and visualizations to portray our research results. 


### Background

Our team selected the topic of food system emissions due to our mutual interests in the environment and agriculture. The global food system  at every stage of food production throughout the world is energy intensive and contributes to GHG production. 


## Data
### Description of Data Source

The data for this project comes from EDGAR-FOOD. EDGAR is a multipurpose, independent, global database of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution on Earth. EDGAR provides independent emission estimates compared to what reported by European Member States or by Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), using international statistics and a consistent IPCC methodology.
