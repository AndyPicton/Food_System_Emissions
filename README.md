## Overview
### Project Description

The focus of our project is on food system greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions throughout the world. We will be analyzing the data for trends utilizing various data analysis techniques and visualizations to portray our research results. 


### Background

Our team selected the topic of food system emissions due to our mutual interests in the environment and agriculture. The global food system  at every stage of food production throughout the world is energy intensive and contributes to GHG production. We would like to discover the impacts of food production on the production of GHG emissions by looking at our food system's emissions over time, across different countries and regions and other elements. We would also like to predict future emissions using a machine learning model. 


## Data
### Description of Data Source

The data for this project comes from EDGAR-FOOD. EDGAR is a multipurpose, independent, global database of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution on Earth. EDGAR provides independent emission estimates compared to what reported by European Member States or by Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), using international statistics and a consistent IPCC methodology.

Our data source contains information on Countries and Regions of the world in regards to their GHG emissions. It contains data on whether a country is developing or industrialized, the type of GHG emission, the year corresponding to the GHG emission amount, and the food stage that corresponds with the amount and type of GHG emitted per year.

### Research Questions

Questions we hope to answer with the data include the following:

- “How is the world’s food system contributing to Greenhouse Gas emissions?”
- "Over time, how has the world’s food system greenhouse gas emissions changed?”
- “Is our food system becoming more GHG emission intensive?”
